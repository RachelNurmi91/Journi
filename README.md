# Journi Travel Companion

While traveling, I noticed confirmations and bookings get lost in emails and there are too many accounts to sign into to access travel information quickly. To combat that issue I created Journi, a fullstack application that allow users to store upcoming travel plans in a singuar place. 

### Included Packges/Libraries
Journi relies on the following packages and libraries.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
